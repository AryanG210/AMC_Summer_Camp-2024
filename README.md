Here are the topics you are gonna learn

# ROS
This phase is all about ROS (Robotics Operating System), as you know simulations solves big problems, it is used to verify, validate and optimize robot designs, systems and their algorithms. ðŸ¤–

# Mechanical Design ðŸ¦¾
Understanding this area is important because it helps designing planes and structures that can handle wind and other air movements well. Not only it is necessary in aerodynamics, it can also be used in other stuff ðŸ˜Ž

# Hardware and Control theory
In the realm of drone technology, hardware and control theory are foundational elements that ensure the effective operation and stability of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).
**Hardware:** This includes the physical components of the drone, such as the frame, motors, propellers, electronic speed controllers (ESCs), batteries, sensors (gyroscopes, accelerometers, GPS), and communication modules. These components work in unison to provide the necessary lift, propulsion, and navigational capabilities. High-quality hardware is crucial for reliable performance, durability, and the ability to handle various environmental conditions.
**Control Theory:** Control theory involves the mathematical modeling and algorithmic design that govern the drone's flight. It encompasses techniques such as PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control, state estimation (e.g., using Kalman filters), and advanced control strategies like model predictive control (MPC) and adaptive control. These methods ensure that the drone can maintain stable flight, respond to pilot commands, and autonomously navigate through complex environments. Control theory is vital for tasks such as stabilization, trajectory tracking, obstacle avoidance, and autonomous mission execution.
Together, hardware and control theory enable drones to perform a wide range of applications, from aerial photography and surveying to search and rescue missions, agricultural monitoring, and beyond. The integration of robust hardware with sophisticated control algorithms allows drones to operate efficiently, safely, and autonomously in diverse scenarios.
