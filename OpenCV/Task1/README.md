## Task1:- Create a Document Scanner

Building a document scanner with OpenCV can be accomplished in just three simple steps:

- Step 1: Detect edges.
- Step 2: Use the edges in the image to find the contour (outline) representing the piece of paper being scanned.
- Step 3: Apply a perspective transform to obtain the top-down view of the document.
