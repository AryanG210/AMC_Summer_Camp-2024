- Bar Code: A barcode is a visual, machine-readable representation of data, typically consisting of parallel lines of varying widths and spacing, used to encode information such as product numbers, serial numbers, and batch numbers for quick retrieval and processing by barcode readers.

- QR Code: A QR (Quick Response) code is a type of matrix barcode (or two-dimensional barcode) consisting of black squares arranged on a white background, which can store a large amount of data and be quickly read by digital devices such as smartphones and QR scanners.

- Your task is to create a Python code which is capable of decoding a bar code or qr code (or both for bonus points) from a live video stream and display the info on screen or capable of directing to the given url
- The more features in your code, the more impressive it will be for scoring good points.
