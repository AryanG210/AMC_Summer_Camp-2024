# Drone Basics 
We have already conducted a workshop on drone basics, before moving ahead just go through [Drone-101](https://github.com/Bhaveshmeghwal21/Drone-101/tree/main)

Now let's move to the task 
## Task 1
Here is a fun activity ðŸ˜ƒ

Now you have to choose components of drones from online store and design a drone. Submit the list of the parts(with link) in excel sheet and calculate flight time for hovering & payload in the submission form

**NOTE** 
- Either you can use this formula $(BatteryCapacity/CurrentDraw)*BatteryDischarge*60 $

# Mechanical Design
If you have not installed Solidworks then you can install it from here

UAVs are complex machines that require careful consideration when it comes to design. By understanding the key design principles involved in UAV technology, including aerodynamics, propulsion, material selection, and control systems, designers can create efficient and reliable machines that can complete their missions safely and effectively. These principles ensure that UAVs are able to perform their tasks with accuracy and precision, while also adhering to necessary safety guidelines.

As UAV technology continues to advance, it is essential for designers to remain knowledgeable of these fundamental design principles in order to create the most effective UAVs.

## Designing drone frame
The mechanical design of a drone frame plays a crucial role in its overall performance, stability, and durability. Letâ€™s explore why itâ€™s so important:

1.**Aerodynamics and Efficiency:**
- Aerodynamic design directly impacts how efficiently a drone moves through the air. By optimizing the shape and structure of the frame, manufacturers can reduce drag and improve overall flight efficiency1.
- A well-designed frame minimizes air resistance, allowing the drone to fly longer distances with less energy consumption.

2. **Structural Integrity and Stability:**
- The strength and rigidity of the frame are critical for maintaining stability during flight. A weak or poorly designed structure can lead to mechanical failure, resulting in a loss of control or damage to the drone2.
- The frame must withstand various forces, including those during takeoff, landing, and maneuvers. Proper mechanical design ensures the frame can handle these stresses.

3. **Weight Optimization:**
- Drone frames need to bear significant loads while remaining lightweight. Less material means reduced weight, which directly affects flight performance.
- Topology optimization techniques, such as using ANSYS, can help optimize frame designs to achieve a balance between strength and weight3. Lighter frames allow for longer flight times and better maneuverability.

4. **Component Integration:**
- The frame serves as the foundation for integrating other components, such as motors, propellers, batteries, and sensors.
- Proper mechanical design ensures that these components fit securely and are positioned optimally for balanced weight distribution and stability.

5. **Material Selection:**
- Choosing the right materials for the frame is essential. Low-weight yet rigid materials (such as carbon fiber or lightweight alloys) are commonly used.
- The frame material affects overall drone weight, durability, and crash resistance.
