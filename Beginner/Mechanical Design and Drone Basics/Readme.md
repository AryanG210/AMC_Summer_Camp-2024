# Drone Basics 
We have already conducted a workshop on drone basics, before moving ahead just go through [Drone-101](https://github.com/Bhaveshmeghwal21/Drone-101/tree/main)

Now let's move to the task 
## Task 1
Here is a fun activity ðŸ˜ƒ

Now you have to choose components of drones from online store and design a drone. Submit the list of the parts(with link) in excel sheet and calculate flight time for hovering & payload in the submission form

**NOTE** 
- When you choose a BLDC motor, you can find a thrust-current relation in their official website so that you can get your current draw with your payload. For eg check out [emax-mt2213 935kv](https://emaxmodel.com/products/emax-mt2213-935kv-multicopter-brushless-motor)
- Also for flight time of hovering, consider current drawn by motor only



# Mechanical Design
If you have not installed Solidworks then you can install it from here

UAVs are complex machines that require careful consideration when it comes to design. By understanding the key design principles involved in UAV technology, including aerodynamics, propulsion, material selection, and control systems, designers can create efficient and reliable machines that can complete their missions safely and effectively. These principles ensure that UAVs are able to perform their tasks with accuracy and precision, while also adhering to necessary safety guidelines.

As UAV technology continues to advance, it is essential for designers to remain knowledgeable of these fundamental design principles in order to create the most effective UAVs.

## Designing drone frame
The mechanical design of a drone frame plays a crucial role in its overall performance, stability, and durability. Letâ€™s explore why itâ€™s so important:

1.**Aerodynamics and Efficiency:**
- Aerodynamic design directly impacts how efficiently a drone moves through the air. By optimizing the shape and structure of the frame, manufacturers can reduce drag and improve overall flight efficiency1.
- A well-designed frame minimizes air resistance, allowing the drone to fly longer distances with less energy consumption.

2. **Structural Integrity and Stability:**
- The strength and rigidity of the frame are critical for maintaining stability during flight. A weak or poorly designed structure can lead to mechanical failure, resulting in a loss of control or damage to the drone2.
- The frame must withstand various forces, including those during takeoff, landing, and maneuvers. Proper mechanical design ensures the frame can handle these stresses.

3. **Weight Optimization:**
- Drone frames need to bear significant loads while remaining lightweight. Less material means reduced weight, which directly affects flight performance.
- Topology optimization techniques, such as using ANSYS, can help optimize frame designs to achieve a balance between strength and weight3. Lighter frames allow for longer flight times and better maneuverability.

4. **Component Integration:**
- The frame serves as the foundation for integrating other components, such as motors, propellers, batteries, and sensors.
- Proper mechanical design ensures that these components fit securely and are positioned optimally for balanced weight distribution and stability.

5. **Material Selection:**
- Choosing the right materials for the frame is essential. Low-weight yet rigid materials (such as carbon fiber or lightweight alloys) are commonly used.
- The frame material affects overall drone weight, durability, and crash resistance.


### Task 2 
For this you have to design a quadcopter frame, you can watch this [tutorial](https://youtu.be/SU8QDIEdPk0?si=UEd9ODGdl9sptwxL)
For submission just screenrecord the last 5 min of designing in solidworks and submit the CAD file & video in link

## Desginging of propellers
The design of a propeller is crucial as it directly impacts the droneâ€™s aerodynamic characteristics, including stability, maneuverability, and efficiency. Propellers are designed with specific airfoil profiles and blade shapes to optimize lift, reduce drag, and generate efficient thrust.


### Task 3 
You have to design a propeller in solidworks just follow this [tutorial](https://youtu.be/SU8QDIEdPk0?si=UEd9ODGdl9sptwxL) and you will understand it 
For submission purpose screen record your last 5 min design and submit the CAD file & video in link
